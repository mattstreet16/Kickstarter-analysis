# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

Performing data analysis on Kickstarter campaigns to uncover trends in the data
---

  Louise needs help setting up a crowd funding campaign to fund her play *Fever*. 
She has Provieded a large raw dataset of kickstarter campaings in Excel to further analyize.

In order to help Louise mirror successful Kickstarter campaigns I needed to impiment some analytical skills on the data in Excel to create a report that accurately displays trends in successful and unsuccessful kickstarter campaigns in the theater Category and play Subcategory. 


   I firstly used conditional formatting rules to create a clear visual element to the data sheet that makes it much eaiser to quickly see the outcomes of each campaign.

  After the data was formatted I used the Round formula in Excel to calculate the percent funded, and average donation, created two new coloumns to record my calculations, I then used the previous conditional formatting rule to formart the two new coloumns

I also converted the Unix timestape dates from their number format to an actual readble date to help the data be more easily understood 

  Once the data was updated and checked, I used advanced filters, and pivot charts and tables to uncover more specific information from the data set. Further filtering the charts based on country, category, and subcategory reavealed important insights.

Louise then informed me she wanted more research done on some specific plays in the United Kingdom, so I used a vlookup formula to find and analyize these specifc kickstarters.

Finally with most of the data analyized, I needed to use descriptive data to better uncover trends in the kickstarter data set and make a chart that displays any tendencies.

 Once I had analyized the kickstarter data it was time to draw some conclusions. Based on my findings the late spring and early summer are the best times to launch a kickstarter campaign, specifically for Louise's theater play, her goal budget is on the higher side, similar kickstart budgets are not always met.
