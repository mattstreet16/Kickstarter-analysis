# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

Performing data analysis on Kickstarter campaigns to uncover trends in the data
---
#### Overview of Project
  Louise, a close friend needs help setting up a crowd funding campaign to fund her play *Fever*. Louise will need around $12,000 to fund her play.
She has provieded a large raw dataset of kickstarter campaings in Excel for me to further analyize and help her better understand what makes a campiagns succeed.

In order to help Louise mirror successful Kickstarter campaigns I needed to impiment some Excel and data analytical skills to create a report that accurately displays trends in successful and unsuccessful kickstarter campaigns in the theater Category and play Subcategory. 

#### Analysis
   I firstly used conditional formatting rules to create a clear visual element to the data sheet that makes it much eaiser to quickly see the outcomes of each campaign.

After the data was formatted I used the Round formula in Excel to calculate the percent funded, and average donation, created two new coloumns to record my calculations, I then applied the previous conditional formatting rule to the average coloumn

I then checked if the dates created and dates ended columns were in unix also converted the Unix timestape dates from their number format to an actual readble date to help the data be more easily understood 

![UnixDates](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99688417/155909363-c3244a76-9306-404b-9493-088308acd544.png)

  Once the data was updated and checked, I used advanced filters, and pivot charts and tables to uncover more specific information from the data set. Further filtering the charts based on country, category, and subcategory reavealed important insights. I specifically filtered data for the United States, the theater Category, and the play subcategory.

Louise then informed me she wanted more research done on some specific plays in the United Kingdom, so I used a vlookup formula to find and analyize these specifc kickstarters so she could compare them to her own campaign.

Finally with most of the data analyized and I had filtered specific data for plays, I needed to use descriptive data to better uncover trends in the kickstarter plays data set and make a chart that displays any tendencies.

Using the descriptive data I could easily create a visual element that shows the distribution of campiagns based on their ential goals and pledges, using this I could see the data was heavily skewed, and I was able to identify any outliers and eliminate them from the dataset.

####  Challenges
The main challenge I encountered with this project was the size of the dataset in relation to the relavent data I needed to help Louise. There are countless kickstarter campiagns in many different categories, however much of this information is not needed. What became crucial in my analysis was my use of filters and pivot charts, these excel tools were crucial to my overall analysis.

#### Results
My final Analysis of the Kickstarter campaign allowed me to draw the conclusions that late spring and early summer are the times of year with the most successful Kickstarter campiagns for plays, and further that Louise should lower her goal amount to ensure that her Kickstarter play is fully funded.  
 
# Challenge Analysis

Written Analysis for Challenge 1

####  Overview of Challenge
Louiseâ€™s play *Fever* nearly met its fundraising goal, and now, she wants to know how different campaigns did in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. To do so I will create two different charts to visualize trends in the data. 

#### Analysis
Firstly, because Louise wanted to compare outcomes of kickstarters based on launch dates I had to calculate the years from the date created conversion column. I used to Year formula to calculate, and input the calculation into a new Years column.

![Years](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99688417/155912882-65a28975-edc9-4376-aec4-2c32a739c101.png)

I had already analyized much of the kickstarter data by now so I quickly created another pivot chart that compared successful, failed, and canceled campigns and filterd the chart to show outcomes filtered by Year and Category. (See Resource Folder). 

Next Lousie wanted me to create another chart what would visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount. To do so I needed to use the Countifs command. I created ranges of goal amounts and used the countif formula in excel to count the number of plays with a given outcome. 

![Outcomevsgoaltable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99688417/155913365-2953a213-0b63-4569-a949-496930df94a7.png)

Using this table I was able to correctly chart the outcomes of the play subcateogry based on the fundraising goal. (see Resource Folder) 

#### Challenges
The main challenge I encountered was creating the ranges for the countifs formula in excel, with so many different ranges writting out each countif formular was very time consuming. My solution to help save some time was to save the base countif formula in a notepad and copy and paste the base formula only changing the range when I need to.

#### Results 
After further examination of kickstarter campaigns in relation to their goal and launch dates I could conclude that, from the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date chart I created it can be concluded that the spring and summer months have a higher success rate for theater kickstarter campaigns, and also theres a fall off in successful campiagns in the winter months. Furthermore, from the GoalsvsOutcomes chart I can conclude that the percentage of successful kickstarter plays gradually falls as the fundraising goal gets higher. Aside from a large spike in plays with a goal from $35000-45000, plays with higher fundraising goals are less likely to be successful 
Despite my detailed analysis of kickstarter campiagns there are still limitations to the data in that the data set contains outliers and is not soley based on theater kickstarters. Furtherermore it would be benfical to include charts that visualize more specific details about successful kickstarters, this would make it much easier for Louise to mirror them.
